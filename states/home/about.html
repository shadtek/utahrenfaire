      <h2>How we got started</h2>
      <p>The Utah Valley Fine Arts Council was created to support the education of the arts in Utah and Utah Valley in particular. We are accomplishing this through outreach programs to local schools and through our main annual event called the Utah Renaissance Faire. This event provides an educational and recreational experience and includes an extensive artisan village, local entertainers and vendors. We feature the local eight time world champion jouster and captain of the Knights of Mayhem, Charlie Andrews who has been active in several national television networks and has just completed a stint on a new Netflix program. He resides in Eagle Mountain. We also feature the local Shakespearean group, Grassroots Shakespeare and offer free evening performances by their troupe. Our event is growing yearly and is gaining public awareness and momentum.</p>
